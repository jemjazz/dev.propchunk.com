								<h2>Location and Demography</h2>
								<p>A representation of locality an demographics of the property</p>
							</center>

									<p>
As of 2011 India census, Palghar had a population of 68,930 Males constitute 36,523 i.e. 52.9% of the population and females 32,407 i.e. 47.1% of the population. Palghar has an average literacy rate of 77.52%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 81.2%, and female literacy is 73.35%. In Palghar, 11.8% of the population is under 6 years of age.
The site is located at Phase 3, VBHC GreenWoods, Palghar District which is 4 kms from Palghar railway station, 7 kms from Umroli station. It is also near to St. John’s college, school, and proposed Delhi-Mumbai Industrial corridor.
</p>

						<img src="images/geography1.png" width="100%" height="100%">

<p>
For a town its size, Palghar is surprisingly cosmopolitan. Being a border town between Gujarat and Maharashtra and being close to Mumbai, it has a good percentage of population of people from other parts of country besides Maharashtra and Gujarat like Rajasthan, Kerala and North India.
The site is well within the prestigious St. John’s Engineering College which ranks as one of the best Engineering colleges in Mumbai outskirts. VBHC’s Palghar project and surrounding properties have been known to fetch a significant premium among investors due to its desirable location. Palghar also got converted into a district recently and it is a connecting district between Mumbai and Gujarat.</p>

						<img src="images/geography2.png" width="100%" height="100%">

<p>The site is close to two railway stations and is surrounded by various parks.
Most of the rich landlords of Palghar made their money trading grass to the dairies in Mumbai. Grass trading is a major occupation of many families in Palghar. The town is also close to an industrial complex, located at Boisar and India's first nuclear power plant, located at Tarapur.
Industrialization is gradually changing the face of Palghar. The town is getting a make-over of sorts due to Industrialization. Palghar's youth is getting employment in the small scale and medium scale industries coming up in and around the area. In the olden days agriculture was one of the main source of livelihood, but industrialization has opened up new avenues for them. With space and infrastructure constraints in Mumbai proper, Vasai, Boisar - Palghar proves to be the leading avenue in Western suburbs for setting up new industry / expansion purposes.
